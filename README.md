4. Update visual elements and data visualizations

### Lens Structure
Each policy requires four perspectives:
```json
{
  "lenses": {
    "karen_fiscal_conservative": {
      "frame": "investment_efficiency",
      "key_message": "Smart spending with measurable returns",
      "evidence_points": ["ROI data", "cost comparisons", "broad support"],
